# PassengerSurvival

## Overview
PassengerSurvival is a data analysis and machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. This project is inspired by the Titanic dataset and aims to showcase data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Implementation of various machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance comparison

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ad1lhasan/PassengerSurvival.git
   cd PassengerSurvival
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the analysis:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify `config.py` to adjust parameters such as dataset path and model hyperparameters.
- Run `main.py` to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
- Check `notebooks/` for detailed EDA and visualization insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
